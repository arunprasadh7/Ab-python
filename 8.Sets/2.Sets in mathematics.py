#Sets in mathematics
S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}

#subset - set containing some elements of the main set
a = {1,2,3,5,7} # a is a subset of S
b = {5,7,9,10}  #b is a subset of S
c = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}  #c is a subset of S & c=S

#proper subset  - set a & b are proper subsets as they are subsets and not equal to c
#               - c is not a proper subset as c==a

#superset - the main set that contains all the elements from the subsets
#           S is a superset of a & b

#disjoint set - 2 subsets that does not contain any similar elements among them
d = {1,2,3,4,5}
e = {6,7,8,9,10}
# d and e are disjoint sets as they do not have any similar elements among them
